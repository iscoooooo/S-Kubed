This repository houses MATLAB functions and Simulink files for small satellite stationkeeping. It incorporates a PI Hexapod, OptiTrack cameras, and an air-bearing in experiments. While the Simulink hub is under development for maneuver testing, it remains a valuable resource for ongoing research and engineering in satellite dynamics.
