# Small Satellite Stationkeeping: *S-Kubed*

This repository houses a comprehensive approach to designing and executing stationkeeping maneuvers tailored for small satellites, including cubesats and Eyassats. The project combines both numerical simulations in MATLAB and experimental procedures conducted in the state-of-the-art Small Satellite lab environment.

## Contents

### MATLAB Numerical Simulations
This section contains scripts and codes for simulating stationkeeping maneuvers in MATLAB. These simulations serve as a foundation for understanding and optimizing maneuver strategies for small satellites.

### Experimental Procedures
Detailed documentation and resources outlining the setup and procedures carried out in the Small Satellite lab. This includes the utilization of high-tech equipment such as the trajectory-simulating Hexapod, OptiTrack camera system for precise position and attitude feedback, and air-bearing for refined attitude control during experiments.

### Simulink Hub Development
An ongoing section dedicated to creating and developing the Simulink hub. This hub integrates OptiTrack cameras, Hexapod, and the satellite, interfacing with various hardware and software components. It's a work-in-progress aimed at streamlining the experimental setup and enhancing control and feedback mechanisms.

### Documentation & Progress Updates
Regularly updated documentation detailing project progress, methodologies, experimental results, and insights gained throughout the development and testing phases.

## Purpose
This repository is part of an undergraduate senior project, under the Aerospace Engineering department at Cal Poly Pomona, dedicated to the design and execution of stationkeeping maneuvers tailored for small satellites like cubesats and Eyassats. It combines both numerical simulations in MATLAB and experimental procedures conducted in the state-of-the-art Small Satellite lab environment.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive resource for the small satellite community, offering insights into theoretical simulations and practical experimentation methodologies for stationkeeping maneuvers. It seeks to showcase the integration of academia and hands-on experimentation by bridging theoretical knowledge with real-world applications for small satellite maneuver optimization.
